    "# Analysis of Endangered Species in National Parks\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The conservation of biodiversity within the National Park Service (NPS) is a critical objective, yet numerous species within this protected areas are classified as endagered. This project seeks to analyze the conservation statuses of endagered species across various national parks to uncover patterns or themese in the types of species affected.\n",
    "## Project Scoping\n",
    "### Project Goals:\n",
    "In this project, the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Parks Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain type of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the difference between species and their conservation statuses significant?\n",
    "- What is most prevalent? What is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- Data Source: The data for this project was provided by [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) for the Biodiversity in National Parks project. The dataset has two data files, `observations.csv` and `species_info.csv`.\n",
    "- Data Content: The first `csv` file holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days. The other file contains information about the different species and their conservation statuses.\n",
    "- Data Preparation: Data cleaning, and handling missing values.\n",
    "This dataset will be used to analyze the goals of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "In this sections, summary statistics and visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will be used to test if the observed vales are statistically significant. Key metrics that will be computed:\n",
    "- Counts\n",
    "- Distributions\n",
    "- relationship between species\n",
    "- conservation status of species\n",
    "- observatios of species in parks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "I will revisit the analysis to check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This seaction will reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"

    "In this project, several data visualizations and inferences were made about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:\n",
    "- What is the distribution of the conservation status of species?\n",
    "    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation (5,633 vs. 191)\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.\n",
    "- Are the difference between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "    - While Mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in consevation percentage, Mammals and Reptiles exhibited a statistically significant difference.\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distirbution amongst parks?\n",
    "    - From this analysis we found that Bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park."

    "This dataset only included observations from the past 7 days which prohibits analysis of changes over time. It would be interesting to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another missing piece of information is the Area of each park. It can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park is much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity. Finally, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial distribution of the species could alse be observed and test if these observations are spatially clustered."

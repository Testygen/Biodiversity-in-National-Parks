    "# Analysis of Endangered Species in National Parks\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The conservation of biodiversity within the National Park Service (NPS) is a critical objective, yet numerous species within this protected areas are classified as endagered. This project seeks to analyze the conservation statuses of endagered species across various national parks to uncover patterns or themese in the types of species affected.\n",
    "## Project Scoping\n",
    "### Project Goals:\n",
    "In this project, the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Parks Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain type of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the difference between species and their conservation statuse significant?\n",
    "- What is most prevalent? What is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- Data Source: The data for this project was provided by [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) for the Biodiversity in National Parks project. The dataset has two data files, `observations.csv` and `species_info.csv`.\n",
    "- Data Content: The first `csv` file holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days. The other file contains information about the different species and their conservation statuses.\n",
    "- Data Preparation: Data cleaning, and handling missing values.\n",
    "This dataset will be used to analyze the goals of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "In this sections, summary statistics and visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will be used to test if the observed vales are statistically significant. Key metrics that will be computed:\n",
    "- Counts\n",
    "- Distributions\n",
    "- relationship between species\n",
    "- conservation status of species\n",
    "- observatios of species in parks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "I will revisit the analysis to check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This seaction will reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"
